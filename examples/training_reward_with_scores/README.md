# Training Reward Model with Scores (in Step2)

ðŸ‘‰ **The ``--disable_dropout`` argument**

Disable the dropout of the model.

ðŸ‘‰ **The ``--gpt_annotated_score`` argument**

Use GPT-annotated scores to train the reward model.

## Format of the Data

The dataset for training reward model should be parquet files including `train.parquet` and `test.parquet`.

To train reward model with scores, there should be extra keys of `chosen_gpt_score` and `rejected_gpt_score` as example below.

Example:

| prompt | response | chosen | chosen_gpt_score | rejected | rejected_gpt_score |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
